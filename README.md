# Coding_Challenge

I enjoyed this challenge very much. After about 3 and a half hours I was finished with this project completely. The last hour or so was spent debugging and refining my code. I also chose to add a feature that tested to make sure the input was a roman numeral or a number, depending on what the user wanted. The program repeats until the user tells it to quit. I wrote my code in repl.it because that was what I used this past semester (Fall 2020) in my CS235 class. You can view this same code on [my repl.it account](https://repl.it/@sbrookec/Coding-Challenge#main.cpp)
